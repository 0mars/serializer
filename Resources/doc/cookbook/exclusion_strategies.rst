Defining which properties should be serialized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default exclusion policy is to exclude nothing, that is all properties of the
object will be serialized. If you only want to expose a few of the properties,
then it is easier to change the exclusion policy, and only mark these few properties:

.. code-block :: php

    <?php

    use JMS\SerializerBundle\Annotation\ExclusionPolicy;
    use JMS\SerializerBundle\Annotation\Expose;

    /**
     * The following annotations tells the serializer to skip all properties which
     * have not marked with @Expose.
     *
     * @ExclusionPolicy("all")
     */
    class MyObject
    {
        private $foo;
        private $bar;

        /**
         * @Expose
         */
        private $name;
    }
